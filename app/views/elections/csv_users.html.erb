    <h1>Upload users from a csv</h1>
    <p>If you have an Excel file (from Log Jam;)) with the emails of all of the users you wish to add to your election this is the place for you!</p>
    <p>1) Make sure your file is formatted properly
    	<ul>
    		<li>Each users email ends with "@pugetsound.edu" (spelled all the way out, no @ups.edu!)</li>
    		<li>Each email is on a new row</li>
    		<li>All emails are in the same column</li>
    		<li>For example:</li>
    		<img src=<%= image_url('usersCSV.jpg')%> style="width:304px;height:228px;">
    		</ul>
    		</p>
    <p>2) Save the file as a .csv</p>
    <p>3) Upload the file below!</p>
    <p>NOTE: A user MUST already have an account to be added to an election.</p>
