This is an application I made for my database management systems class (CS455).

The app is an election application for on-campus clubs. It allows clubs to quickly set up and election, have members run for positions, and see the results. The app was built using Ruby on Rails and was backed by an SQLite database. I contributed to the project under my school git-hub username "ecarlin-ups".
