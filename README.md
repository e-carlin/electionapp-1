This is a website I worked on for my database managment class (CS455). The website creates a platform for on campus clubs to easily and quickly hold elections. As of December 1, 2016 the website was hosted on an EC2 instance, ec2-52-40-34-90.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com . The website was created using Ruby on Rails and is backed up by an SQLite database.


I contributed to the project under my school github account, "ecarlin-ups".
